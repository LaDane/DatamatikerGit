## JavaScript Objects

1. Create an object with four different properties, with values, of your own choice (ex: name, birthday, hobby, email).

2. Use a for-in loop (as sketched below) to demonstrate that we can iterate over the properties in an object.

        for(prop in myObj){
        console.log(prop,myObj[prop]);
        }

3. Use the delete keyword to demonstrate we can delete existing properties from an object (delete a property, and iterate over the properties again).

4. Add a new property to your object to demonstrate that we can add new properties to existing objects.

5. Create a Constructor function to create new Persons having:
    - a firstName, lastName and an age.
    - a method to get details about the Person
