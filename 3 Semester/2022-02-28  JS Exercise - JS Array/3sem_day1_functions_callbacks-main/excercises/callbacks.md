## Excercises


1. Call all three functions in `script.js`. 
    - Itâ€™s not about doing it as fast as you can, but about understanding what's happening, so make sure you understand each line. The questions might seem trivial, but it's extremely important that you can answer (and understand) each, in order to do the JS-stuff we want to do this semester

2. Write a `mul(n1, n2)` function (inspired by add and sub) and use it as the callback for the cb function.

</br>

3. Call `cb()`, this time with an anonymous function that divides the first argument with the second.

**More about Callbacks**

Take another look at the function expression declared in `cb()`, and the provided callbacks in 5+6. What we have in `cb()` is a very generic function, that can take any callback that can do something with two numbers and return a value.
